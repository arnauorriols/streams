# IOTA Streams libraries

The `streams` library is currently available in the following languages:

- [Rust](rust/getting_started) 
- [Wasm](wasm/getting_started) 
- [C](c/getting_started) 

## Getting Started

The recommended approach to start your interactions with IOTA is to use a developer network. A public API load balancer is provided here: [api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe](api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe)

The test network explorer is available at the [IOTA Tangle explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/devnet/).
