/// Streams `Error`
///
/// This enum includes all possible errors returned by the fallible operations of this library.
/// The errors have been classified according to the different business logic that they are expected
/// to trigger:
/// - `Transport`: the transport layer has experienced a temporary malfunction. The operation can be
///   attempted again as is once the transport layer recovers
/// - `Data`: the data provided by the user involved in the operation is invalid. The operation can
///   be attempted again once the data has been corrected
/// - `Setup`: the environment in which the operation is being performed is incorrect. The operation
///   can be attempted again once the environment has been ammended
/// - `Permission`: the user does not have permission to perform the operation. The operation should
///   not be attempted again unless the permissions of the user change
/// - `MessageNotFound`: the message being fetched has not been found by the transport layer. The
///   operation might be attempted again after a while to check if the message has been published
/// - `Fatal`: the user is attempting an impossible operation and should desist from it.
/// - `Unwrapping`: the user is attempting to unwrap an invalid message. Spam messages would fall
///   into this error, so this kind of error should be logged carefully.
/// - `CacheMiss`: the message could not be wrapped or unwrapped because the Spongos state of the
///   message it is linked to cannot be found in the cache. The operation can be attempted again as
///   is once the linked message is fetched
